     <h1 >ABOUT US </h1>
	<br>
	<p style="font-size:25px"> Blood donation is an extremely noble deed, yet there is scarcity of regular donors across INDIA .<br>
	WE FOCUS on creating and expanding a virtual army of blood donating volunteers 
	who could be searched and contacted by family/care givers of a patient in times of need .</p>



<p style="font-size:15px"> We as a team have tried to develop a platform to help search donors according to your location and your required blood group with a click .<br>
Humanity teaches us to help the one in need and sometimes we are unable to help even after being nearby . Simply because there is no way anyone could know that there blood 
could have saved someone around them .<br>
</p>

<p style="font-size:15px"> Our website provides medium to both , the one in need and the one can help the needy just by a simple procedure . We provide the needy with the details of our registered donors to
the people who need a particular blood group in a particular location . Your registration as a donor just might save someone's life with a click . </p>
